## Hi, welcome to my GitHub!

I'm a cloud-certified developer from France, in love with learning.

Throughout my studies and work experiences I have grown to enjoy backend development with a hint of data engineering quite a bit. Working with the cloud gave me a greater vision of what development can look like and its many challenges.

### I'm currently working on

- travel_helper: a project fueled by my girlfriend and I's love for travelling. Cheaper airlines and their luggage restriction create a huge friction point with weight, I'm working on designing a simple tool that would allow us to list our belongings and then shaping up a luggage that doesn't exceed the given weight
- Create cheatsheets for the Terraform and AWS knowledge I've acquired through the certifications.

### I'm currently learning

- GraphQL
- Vue.Js, Vite, Next.Js
